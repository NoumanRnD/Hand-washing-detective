# Hand-washing-detective
To observe if the users wash their hands by utilising camera frames
The project should use OpenCV and apply your knowledge on loops, arrays, file<br/>
reading/writing, functions and classes. At least one class should be defined.<br/>
Hand washing detective:<br/><br/>
1. To observe if the users wash their hands by utilising camera frames<br/>
2. If so, to observe the duration of hand-washing, and if soap is applied<br/>
3. To record the hand-washing data via capturing user images<br/>
And I can go beyond as well.<br/>
